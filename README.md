# Game 7

This prototype explores 8-bit/retro style gaming.

#### Title Screen

![title screen](assets/textures/title.png)

### Features include:
- Stateful Hot-reloading (via .DLL + file watcher)
- Metaprogramming (via [mikesmullin/metacode](https://github.com/mikesmullin/metacode/))
- Modular
- Object-Oriented (ie. `Class__Method` naming convention)
- Inheritance (via Struct Composition) w/ method overriding (via [Dispatcher](src/game/Dispatcher.c))
- Debug tools (sprintf to screen, Pixel Inspector, visual breakpoints, perf timers)

## Building

### on Windows
Start the game.
```
C:\> node build_scripts/Makefile.mjs all
```
Enable hot-reload. (ie. when editing [`Logic.c`](src/game/Logic.c))
```
C:\> node build_scripts/Makefile.mjs watch
```
